## Post and Chat

### Description
Post and Chat is a forum-like application. People can share their ideas and interests to each other.

### Technologies I use in Post and Chat
1. React-Router
Post and Chat is a single-page application(SPAs)!

2. Redux
To manage application states and actions.

3. User Authentication System
Users need to sign up or login before writing a post. Users must enter the valid format of email address and password to signup or login, otherwise it will generate an error.

4. RESTful API
Post and Chat will use RESTful APIs to get weather data from the server after signing up so the current weather will be displayed.
